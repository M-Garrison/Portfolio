                            As the Fulfilment Manager, I was responsible for staffing and training new teammates, inventory control as well as making sure all orders shipped on time with accuracy. 
                            I also managed the hazardous and international shipments and was certified to operate all types of warehouse equipment.
                            Implementing a 5S organizational system with the company, one of my main points of focus was on efficiency in the warehouse and how we could work smarter. 
                            As Amazon became our primary customer, I also have experience dealing with and training others on navigating Amazon vendor central and its user interface.</div>

                        As the Warehouse Lead, I managed a team of order pickers who used RF scanners as well as voice picking technology to select and build stocking orders which provided critical medical supplies to hospitals across the state.
                        Main job duties included releasing and assigning orders, training and auditing teammates for accuracy as well as managing the workflow of the warehouse. I also maintained communication between management, customer service, and the warehouse team, keeping everyone up to date and on the "same page".
                        During my time with Owens and Minor I held titles like distribution coordinator, safety team member, teammate trainer as well as multiple warehouse lead positions. I also represented the Washington warehouse by traveling to other distribution centers in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston and Richmond, VA. 
                        Also certified in all types of material and equipment handling, Haz-mat disposal, and safety-team training.</div>

                        As the Shipping and Receiving Manager, it was my responsibility to verify all incoming and outgoing shipments.
                        The Home Depot received freight 24 hours a day, therefore I managed a team of associates with staggered shifts, which maintained an associate was always around to unload trucks and receive freight when necessary. 
                        The Receiving department was also in charge of the return to vendor and buyback products, requiring a full-time associate shipping returned and defective products out and obtaining credits from vendors.
                        Working for the Home Depot nearly three years I worked in multiple departments with varying titles; including customer service associate, department lead, crew supervisor as well as the shipping and receiving manager position. 
                        Other job titles included key carrying manager, store transfer captain, safety team member.
                        Certified in hazardous materials disposal as well as heavy equipment operations and training.</div>
