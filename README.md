Project #1: 
MY PORTFOLIO SITE   

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery.

APPROACH TAKEN:
With my portfolio I took the approach of wanting a clean and easy to navigate page that at the very least hit the MVP mark. As I progressed in making the page I discovered I just wanted to continue adding features and styling it with CSS that went beyond the MVP requirements. 

LINK TO LIVE SITE:
...

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
Open "portfolio/index.html" in a browser.

UNSOLVED PROBLEMS:
Would like to make one <div> close if another <div> is opened.

FUTURE PLANS:    
Add more projects and links in the future.
Allow .pdf of resume to be downloaded from link on resume page.
